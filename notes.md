1️⃣3️⃣ When to Use NetworkX?

✅ Use NetworkX if:

Graph size is small to medium

You need fast prototyping

You want easy algorithms

❌ Don’t use if:

Graph is extremely large (millions of nodes) → use Graph-tool / Neo4j

🔥 Important for Interviews & Projects

You should remember:

Graph() vs DiGraph()

BFS / DFS

Shortest path

Centrality

PageRank

Adjacency matrix
